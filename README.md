# HOLONIC-RELATIONSHIP-BUILDING

The Holonic way
Holonic <www.linkedin.com/company/becomeholonic/> is a California-based newcomer to the market that builds product-oriented development teams (POD) for startups. We meet the resourcing needs of product and engineering leaders with fully unified and aligned squads of product developers. Our team of experienced leaders in engineering, product, social dynamics, and psychology has codified decades of team-building experience into a repeatable process for forging a group of individual Software Engineers into a cohesive, high-performing product development team.

Our partners are Silicon Valley and New York startups and early-stage companies that operate in a wide variety of sectors (Recruitment and Selection, Healthcare, Food, Finance, Blockchain, Sports, NFT).

In a little over a year, we have grown from nothing to 94 workers and 11 teams, and we are looking for great people who are also great professionals to be part of this growth with us!

About our roles
You will work in a cross-functional and multidisciplinary team of up to 5-7 members, each member in their respective area (Backend Engineer + Frontend Engineer + DevOps Engineer + Machine Learning Engineer or Blockchain Developer).

More important than the technology itself, is the team bond we create. To build this special bond and before placement with a client, the new team goes through a 4-week training process to form these 5-7 individuals into a single unit and, most importantly, to improve their understanding of the product. 

The team goes through group dynamic and psychological training to improve the essential skills that a high-performing team needs to function: Communication, collaboration, respect, understanding of a common goal, and disagreement on ideas rather than people.
